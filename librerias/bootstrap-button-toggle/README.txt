 Working on a client project that will be using Bootstrap, and needed to build a toggle/switch that came in a couple different sizes. I wasn't seeing that as a built-in option within Bootstrap, and I didn't really like the ones already out there that I found from a quick search (I didn't want to use a plugin, just wanted it to utilize Bootstrap's built-in JS), so I decided to make my own.

This example is just using the default "Quick Add" Bootstrap CSS & JS, no added/custom JS on my part, I've simply utilized Bootstrap's buttons.js Single Toggle method (http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#buttons) and added some custom styling (LESS).
